# repo_from_hell
This repo is too hot to be reviewed by mere mortals!

Hello! This is my repository for putting all of the files I create on my learning path of Git, web development, Haskell, Linux shell scripting, and algorithms and data structures.
Feel free to look into any of the files and folders, but I warn you! You do that of your own free will, and it's not my responsibility what happens to you after reviewing my code!

Enjoy the repo_from_hell!

#FAREWELL
